# IT Tools — Self-Hosted IT Utility Stack

## Overview

Deployed **IT Tools** as a self-hosted utility platform within my Ubuntu Docker environment.

The goal was to provide a locally hosted collection of common IT, networking, security, encoding, and development utilities that I can access from my homelab without relying on multiple external websites.

## Environment

* Ubuntu Docker host
* Docker / Docker Compose
* Self-hosted on my home network
* Managed alongside other homelab services
* No requirement to expose the service directly to the public Internet

## Practical Uses

Rather than deploying IT Tools simply to experiment with another Docker container, I have already incorporated several of its utilities into actual homelab projects.

### SSH Key Utilities

Used IT Tools while learning and implementing SSH public/private key authentication.

This supported my transition from password-based SSH access to key-based authentication for systems within my homelab, including my Ubuntu Docker server.

This project helped reinforce concepts including:

* Public and private key pairs
* SSH authentication
* Key fingerprints
* Secure remote administration
* Passwordless SSH access

### QR Code Generation

Used the QR code utilities while building a **Guest Wi-Fi QR/NFC project**.

The generated QR code was incorporated into a custom physical guest Wi-Fi plaque designed for 3D printing. Guests can scan the QR code to simplify connecting to the guest wireless network.

This connected several areas of the homelab:

**Networking → Self-Hosted Tools → QR Code → 3D Design → Physical Deployment**

### General IT Utilities

IT Tools also provides a centralized location for frequently needed utilities such as:

* Base64 encoding and decoding
* Hash generation
* UUID generation
* JSON formatting
* URL encoding and decoding
* Network calculations
* Encryption and security utilities
* Text conversion and formatting

## Why Self-Host It?

Many of these utilities are readily available through public websites, but hosting them locally provides several advantages:

* Keeps potentially sensitive input within my own environment
* Reduces dependence on third-party utility websites
* Provides one consistent interface for common administrative tools
* Adds another practical Docker workload to my homelab
* Provides hands-on experience deploying and maintaining containerized applications

## What I Learned

This was a relatively small deployment, but it became useful almost immediately.

More importantly, it demonstrated something I continue to focus on with my homelab: **deploying technology to solve an actual problem rather than simply installing software.**

IT Tools is now part of my growing collection of self-hosted infrastructure and administration services, and its SSH and QR utilities have already supported other projects within the environment.

## Next Steps

* Integrate IT Tools into my homelab dashboard
* Continue identifying utilities that can replace external web-based tools
* Document additional real-world use cases as they are incorporated into future projects
* Maintain the deployment alongside the rest of my Docker Compose infrastructure
